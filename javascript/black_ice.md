The black ice that sets my skin on fire,
Is the very same that life blooms into;

The piercing motion followed by;
A piercing moment.

In that moment I am greater than I was or will ever/be again



```javascript
black_ice.skin.fire()
black_ice.default.bloom()


let { soon, too } = await piercing_motion()
setTimeout(() => {
	piercing_moment()
}, too - soon)
