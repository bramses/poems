 * in a stodged room, six feet above the others
 * i rest my elbow upon a gilded throne
 * from here i command everything that happens, there is nothing I cant know
 * 
 * servants bustle about, doing my bidding
 * but when i ask to step off my throne, they conjure up excuses
 * 
 * because the clawed feet of my throne touch the ground
 * i think i do too
 * but when the throne is removed
 * i think i go too
